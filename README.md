### requirements

Final Project
The idea of the final project for you is to demonstrate your Laravel skills.
The DEADLINE is final session of our classes. Don't miss the deadline, you won't be assessed if missed...
By the end of that session you should send me the ZIP file of your project source code. I should run composer, migrations, seeders, artisan serve and launch the project in the browser (or you can use Sail & Docker).
I do not asses the user interface/frontend part of your project. One requirement is to use Blade templates (not React or Livewire or enything else).
I will be checking your Laravel source code, how you structure your code, how clear and well it is written. Use the Laravel best practices. Do your project in a Laravel Way...
Select which project you want to do out of these tree (task manager, finance tracker and blog platform). If you don't select it for the next session, I will randomly assign projects to you.
